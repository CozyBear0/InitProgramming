#### Computing and the manhatan project

Before computers became the modern electric desktops or laptops of today, “computers” actually referred to the people who did computing or calculations of equations. These computers would rely on their own intellect and later, desktop calculator machines and mathematics tables. The people serving as “human computers” were commonly women. While some women had degrees in mathematics or physics, others were recruited mainly because they were a convenient and available source of labor, especially during wartime.
